Developing first decentralized application from scratch on the Ethereum blockchain using solidity language.
I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, bootstrap 4), NodeJS, webpack, npm, Web3.js. When I created/rebuild my smartcontracts I acquired Solidity language basics. I got acquainted more with the Ethereum network and related programs Geth, Genache, Truffle.
