# BetterWorld platform test page. Where you can buy, send or donate BetterToken. 
My first project. Not updated since July.
Developing first decentralized application from scratch on the Ethereum blockchain using solidity language.
I have gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery, bootstrap 4), NodeJS, webpack, npm, Web3.js. When I created/rebuild my smartcontracts I acquired Solidity language basics. I got acquainted more with the Ethereum network and related programs Geth, Genache, Truffle.
